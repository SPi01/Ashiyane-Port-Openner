# Ashiyane Port Openner

Hi Githubs. Glad to see you :)

After months working with C#, im here for interducing my latest program design specially for Windows.
This program work with port communications. Actually, you just enter the port i wanna open and then the program opens it for you while using it. 

This mean after you close the program, port would be close too. So this is not dangerous at all. Also, after opening specific port, you should approve the Firewall attention.
Thanks any way !
